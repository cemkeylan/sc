sc
=======

Simplistic hyper-minimal static portable C99 POSIX shell service manager in 
POSIX compliant shell script in a single minimal line of code. It is so 
simple, that it can be run under all POSIX systems. It is so static that 
this readme is part of this hyper-minimal service manager.

Dependencies
============

- systemd
- POSIX make

The `Makefile` is built-in for maximum minimalistic static-link-like 
portability coolness!

Install
=======

In order to install sc, run (as root if needed):

    ./sc --install PREFIX=/usr

Rant
====

If you still did not pick up on the sarcasm, this is how you look like with 
your minimalistic 'Boost/jQuery/some-other-bloat-library' programs.
SLOC doesn't mean anything if you are calling a huge piece of crap to make 
up for your lack of skills.

If you are making your code unreadable for the sake of SLOC, you are also 
in the wrong. You may not be calling a huge library, but you are giving 
others (and yourself) a hard time reading your code. You should always make 
sure your code is readable and well commented instead of garbling it up to 
brag about your code size. Just take a look at this mess of a code, it 
really is a one-line shell script containing this README file, and it is an 
absolute pain to read. Don't be like this, be smart.
